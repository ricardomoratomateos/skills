# QA Login — session management (per environment)

Logs into the target environment and persists the session **scoped to that environment**, so a QA
session that touches more than one environment never has one login overwrite another. Sessions are
saved in the workspace and survive across runs: if a valid session already exists for the
environment, the rest of the pipeline reuses it without logging in again.

Fully autonomous: this skill never asks anything. When it cannot log in, it records a
machine-readable status that the rest of the pipeline turns into Pending or Failed entries in the
report.

## Workspace layout (the same for every skill in this pipeline)

Everything lives under `.qa-workspace/` at the root of the repository under test. It holds
credentials and sessions, so it is **always git-ignored** — the bootstrap enforces this.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.qa-workspace/.env` | Secrets: the values for the environment variables the profiles name. `chmod 600`. |
| `.qa-workspace/profile/` | The app profile: `profile.yml`, `MEMORY.md`, `notes.md`. |
| `.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.json` | storageState per environment, shared by every run. |
| `.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.status.json` | Last login status for that environment. |
| `.qa-workspace/plans/<ref>.md` | One plan per PR (written by `qa-prepare`). |
| `.qa-workspace/tests/<ref>/` | Per-run artifacts: flows, seeds, evidence, report. |

The workspace is local to the repository under test, so it holds exactly one profile.

Credentials live **only** in `.qa-workspace/.env`. The profile only ever names the variables
(`userSecret: APP_TEST_USER`); it never contains a value. Never print a secret's value, never write
it to any other file, never put it in the plan or the report.

### First run — bootstrap the browser tool

The browser is driven through **Playwright CLI** (`@playwright/cli`, the official
[microsoft/playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli)). If the command is not on
the PATH, install it before anything else — never write a failure report for a tool you can mount
yourself:

```bash
command -v playwright-cli >/dev/null || npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

If the first `open` fails because the browser binary is missing, the error names the exact install
command — run it and retry once. If the install itself fails (no npm, no network), stop with a
clear message naming what is missing.

### First run — bootstrap the workspace

If `.qa-workspace/` does not exist, create it and stop with a clear message instead of guessing
credentials. **Git-ignoring the workspace is part of the bootstrap, not optional**: it contains
credentials and session cookies.

```bash
mkdir -p .qa-workspace/sessions .qa-workspace/plans .qa-workspace/tests .qa-workspace/profile
grep -qxF '.qa-workspace/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.qa-workspace/' >> .gitignore
cat > .qa-workspace/.env <<'EOF'
# Fill in the variables the app profile names (never commit this file anywhere)
APP_TEST_USER=
APP_TEST_PASS=
EOF
chmod 600 .qa-workspace/.env
```

If the repository under test is not git-tracked or has no `.gitignore`, still create the entry —
an ignored directory that ignores nothing is the failure mode to avoid.

Then print: `First run in this repository — created .qa-workspace/ (git-ignored). Fill in
.qa-workspace/.env and the profile under .qa-workspace/profile/ before retrying.` and stop.

## Instructions

### 1. Load configuration

1. Take the target environment URL (`baseUrl`) from the invocation — the branch environment the
   caller wants to test. If none is given, use `env.defaultUrl` from the profile.
2. Read `.qa-workspace/profile/profile.yml` — take the `auth` block:
   - `auth.loginPath` (e.g. `/login`)
   - `auth.credentials.userSecret` / `auth.credentials.passSecret` — the **names** of the variables
   - `auth.form.*` — optional explicit selectors
   - `auth.success` / `auth.failure` — indicators
   - `auth.sso` — detection strings
3. Read the credentials from `.qa-workspace/.env`, using the variable names the profile gives.

If either credential is absent or empty, do not guess and do not retry: write
`.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.status.json` with

```json
{ "status": "failed", "reason": "missing-credentials", "detail": "<which variable is empty in .qa-workspace/.env>" }
```

and stop. The caller turns this into `error.kind: "login-failed"` in the report.

### 2. Refuse to run against production

Read `env.forbiddenHosts` and `env.productionHosts` from the profile. If the host of `baseUrl`
matches any of them, or the profile declares no branch/staging pattern that this host satisfies,
**stop immediately**: write the status file with `"reason": "production-target"` and do not open a
browser.

**Never against production: branch environments and staging only.**

### 3. Determine the environment slug

- Take the host of `baseUrl`, stripped of protocol and trailing slash.
- Derive the **slug** using `env.slugRule` from the profile. The default rule:
  - the develop host → `develop`
  - a host matching the branch pattern → `branch-<name>` (keep the `branch-` prefix, it disambiguates
    from `develop`/`staging`)
  - anything else → the full host with `.` replaced by `-`
- Session file: `.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.json`. **Never write to a shared or generic
  filename** — that reintroduces the single-session problem this skill exists to avoid.

### 4. Open the browser and navigate to the login page

```bash
playwright-cli open {baseUrl}{auth.loginPath}
playwright-cli snapshot
```

### 5. Detect SSO before attempting a normal login

Look at the snapshot. If there is no visible email/password form — only the SSO buttons the profile
lists in `auth.sso.detectText` (e.g. "Continue with Google" / "Sign in with Google") — **stop here**.
Automating a third-party OAuth flow with Playwright runs into the provider's bot detection, so it is
not supported.

Write `.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.status.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "sso-only",
  "reason": "sso-only",
  "detail": "The test account requires <provider> SSO. Third-party OAuth cannot be automated. Configure a test account with native email+password login in this app profile."
}
```

and close the browser. **This is Pending, not a failure**: `qa-execute` marks every flow as Pending
with this explanation and the run's global verdict is `warn`. Never report a failure the application
did not actually produce.

Do not click the SSO button and do not guess its flow.

### 6. Fill the login form

If the profile provides `auth.form.emailSelector` / `passwordSelector` / `submitSelector`, use them.
Otherwise identify the fields from the snapshot by their ref IDs, using the usual heuristic:
`input[type=email]` (or the first text input in the form), `input[type=password]`, and the form's
submit button.

```bash
playwright-cli fill {email-ref} "{user}"
playwright-cli fill {password-ref} "{pass}"
playwright-cli click {submit-ref}
```

Never echo the password into the transcript, a log line or a replay script.

### 7. Verify the login succeeded

Wait for the redirect, then take a snapshot.

**Success indicators** (profile `auth.success`, with these defaults):
- the URL moved away from the login path (e.g. to `/home` or `/dashboard`)
- the page shows user-related elements (avatar, menu, company name)
- no error message is visible

**Failure indicators** (profile `auth.failure`): any of the listed texts is visible
("Invalid credentials", "Wrong password"...).

If the page still looks blank, take one more snapshot after a brief pause before concluding
anything — a slow render is not a failed login.

**If login failed**: write the status file with `"status": "failed"`,
`"reason": "invalid-credentials"` (or `"unreachable"` if the page never loaded) and the observed
error text as `detail`. Close the browser and stop. Do NOT proceed and do NOT retry in a loop.

### 8. Save the session state

```bash
playwright-cli state-save .qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.json
```

Read the file back and confirm it contains cookies (not just `{}`). Some apps keep their token in
localStorage instead of cookies — if the file has no cookies, check
`playwright-cli localstorage-list` and include those entries in the session.

### 9. Close the browser and record success

```bash
playwright-cli close
```

Write `.qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.status.json`:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "slug": "<slug>", "session": ".qa-workspace/sessions/<slug>.json", "url": "<baseUrl>" }
```

Print one line: `Login ok at <baseUrl> — session saved for <slug>`. Never print the credentials.

## Sessions are per environment, not shared

Each environment gets its own file under `.qa-workspace/sessions/`. Re-running this skill for the
same environment overwrites only that environment's file. This is what lets `qa-prepare` and
`qa-execute` work against more than one environment without invalidating each other's session — and
what lets a session saved today be reused by tomorrow's run without logging in again.

## Troubleshooting

- **Page doesn't load**: the environment may not be deployed yet. Record `"reason": "unreachable"` —
  the caller maps it to `error.kind: "env-unreachable"`.
- **Fields not found in the snapshot**: the login page changed. Fall back to the generic selectors of
  step 6, and record the mismatch as an observation so `qa-memory` can update the profile's notes.
- **Session empty after save**: see the localStorage note in step 8.
- **401/403 later while using this session**: it expired — re-run this skill for that same
  environment and retry the request once. Other environments' sessions are unaffected.
